# Create-New-Project-simply

### I use sublime text if you use another text editor you have to change "subl" to "code" for example (for vscode).

### In the desktop file you need to change the location of the bash file and the icon. you must also right click on it and select "alow launching".

### In new-project.sh you have to change the location several places. And make him executable (chmod +x)
